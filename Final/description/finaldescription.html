            <h2>TRIGGERS</h2>
            <p>Trigger is the hover on the project card</p>
            <h2>RULES</h2>
            <p>Once a pointer is hovered over the drexel card, in 250ms, the card will scale up by 5% and the details
                card would pop up with a golden background and cover the original card completely. <br>

                <br>

                <br>

                The details card would have 3 elements and each of them have a different rule. these are:
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> Main Heading: Drexel Athletics:the Main heading opacity and scale will change from 0-100% with
                        a transition delay of 100ms. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Brief: opacity and size will change from 0-100% with a transition delay of 200ms. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Software tags:The software tag opacity and size will change from 0-100% with a transition delay
                        of 250ms. </li> <br>
                        <li>View Project Button: Comes into opacity 0 to 1 in 650ms.</li>
                        <li>Beta Addition: 1) I added a box shadow that takes the same color as the details card. The shadow appears in 250ms. 
                            <br> I also added a View project button which will change from opacity 0 to 100% in 650ms. Once hovered the View Project button will change background from green to black.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
            <p>The Feedback would be the visibilty of the details Card with slightly increased size (5%) & the visibilty
                of the Main Heading, details, and software tags on the card one by one. At the end the view project button will appear which when hovered, changes color as feedback.</p>
            <h2>LOOPS</h2>
            <p>There are no loops </p>

            <h2>MODES</h2>
            <p>There are no modes.</p>
