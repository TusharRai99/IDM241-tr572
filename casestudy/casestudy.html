            <h2 id="over" >Overview </h2>
            
            <h4 class="bold" >This project was designed for my Microinteractions class at Drexel University. In the project I was assigned the task to create meaningful microinteractions of our liking. We did research on some Microinteractions we liked and deconstructed them to understand what engages the user and through what ways. I did research on creating a hover card that displays basic details of the project on hovering with the cursor. The details card also has an option to view a full preview of the project. Once the ‘View Project Preview’ button is clicked, a modal opens which shows the hero image of the project and other main details like Project Info, Roles & Responsibilities, and tools used.
            </h4>

            <h2 id="cont" >Context and Challenge </h2>
            <h4 class="bold" >As mentioned before, this project was done for my Microinteractions class and was supposed to be completed in a 10 week period of time. The languages we used for the project were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Ultimately, I wanted to use this class to design something that I could use in my portfolio as well. I had a lot of projects in my portfolio and wanted to do something that lets a user take a quick overview of my project without actually opening the whole project. This led me to search about the kind of microinteractions that enhance user experience when looking through multiple projects online. 
            </h4>
                

            
             <h2 id="prob" >The Problem</h2>
             <h4 class="doublebold"> The problem was to find a microinteraction that is both meaningful and useful in such a way that it can be applied to my online portfolio. I wanted something that gives surface level details of the project so that the visitor can look into my work without opening the full webpage. The main problem was to use code that is both simple and yet provides a good user experience.</h4>
                        
            
        

            <h2 id="go" >DESIGN GOALS </h2>
            <h4 class="bold"> My goal was to create a preview card and a preview modal. The preview card would show up if someone hovers their mouse or pointer on one of my project cards. The preview card would show details such as Title, Summary, and a View Project Preview Button, which opens the preview modal when it is clicked. The preview modal would have details such as The Hero Image, Project Info, Roles and Responsibility and tools used. This modal would give the user a high-level overview of my projects.
            </h4>

            <h2 id="met" >Tangible Goals & Metrics Used</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">Some of the tangible goals would be to create a hover effect on my project card that shows the preview card. The other part would be the creation of the preview modal and linking it to the preview card. I would consider this project successful if I can implement both of these parts and if it provides a good user experience to other users that will be testing the project. I would also create a google form survey that would help me with feedback once I finish the project.

            <h4 class="bold">Since I already had an idea of what I wanted to do from looking at examples from website above (look at image above). I spent time putting in thoughts on what my Alpha would look like. I started from defining Triggers, Rules, Feedback, Loops and Modes for each element and sub element of the preview card. I wanted the preview card to have the following microinteraction: 
                <br>
                Once the cursor is hovered, the project card changes to the preview card which has a different background and slightly larger size than the preview card. It would have the details such as Title, Summary and Softwares used. Below is a representation of what it would look like.

            <h4 class="bold">I worked on my Alpha project to refine it more. I also added much more detailed rules for each element and sub elements of the preview card. Below are more details and a link that shows the beta build in action.

            <h4 class="bold">After much more refinements and feedback I was able to come up with a final version of the Microinteraction. I also added a view project preview button that opens the preview modal with more details.  Below are more details and a link that shows the final build in action.

            <h2 id="ch" >PROJECT CHALLENGES:</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">Facing the problem of transitions: Once I was able to set all the code for the Preview  Card and the Preview Modal. I realized that I was not able to make the details of the preview card appear one after the other. I used multiple ways to add a transition delay to the sub elements of the Preview Card but almost all of them were unsuccessful. I even tried to book two meetings with my professor but every code I used broke the previous code I had. Similar things happened when I tried to animate the opening and closing of the Preview Modal. I found that the code used for animating the opening and closing of the Modal used SASS which I had little to no previous experience with. I also discussed it with my professor about the transitions and animations but little progress was achieved in these two tasks.I also realized that creating transition delays in Preview Card does not add much effect on the user experience.
                Ultimately, I decided to skip working on the code for transition delays in Preview Card and animating the Preview Modal. This was necessary as I had multiple projects and very little time.

                </div>
        
                <h2 id="re" >RESULTS</h2>
            <h4 class="bold">The results were not perfect but satisfying. I think the project was a success as I was able to create both the Preview Card and Preview Modal and both of them functioned well as well as showed all the details I wanted to show through them, which were my direct goals of this project.
<br>
<br>
                Through my surveys I found 75% of the people liked the Preview Card and Modal and liked how it offered a short overview of my projects without getting too deep in the project.
          <br> 
          <br>     
                Even Though I could not work on transition delays and modal animations I still learned a lot in this class through this project. I realized the importance of setting a realistic goal in the beginning and working on small elements of the microinteractions one by one. I also learned a lot about reusing code from already made examples and other websites and how to tailor it so it fits in my webpage.
      <br> 
      <br>         
                In the future, I would love to add more transition delays and nice animations to every small element of the microinteraction I created.
